# DuelKit

DuelKit is a game framework for creating 2-player minigames that can accommodate diverse game mechanics. DuelKit supports minigames with a single button input for each player, which can be used to perform actions in the game. Players compete for points and whoever reaches 5 points first wins.

We are using the Entity Component System (ECS) software architectural pattern, a popular pattern in the game development industry. It is especially suited for writing our game framework as we are aiming for flexibility, and ECS allows for extensive “mix-and-match”. We are referencing Adam Martin's definitions of Entity Component Systems, as described in his series of [blog posts](https://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/).
